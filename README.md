# WEB501Project1

The website i have created is a video game and console store similar to EB Games called
MD Games. The store sells everything video game related. The website advertises games that 
have just released and the consoles those games are played on. Git was used to track the
entire process of building this website.

## Project Notes

I wanted to use more advanced Javascript feature and somthing more original then the accordian (used in previous assignments)
but the way i designed my website something was conflicting with everything i tryed to implement, and i spent hours trying to get 
my original ideas to work but had no luck with it. I ended up putting those features in because i ran out of time and needed to do other work.

All purchase and pre order buttons have no functionality when clicked.
